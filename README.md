# Study-Planner
This is a To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQLite for data storage. It allows users to add, delete, and view tasks. The application supports persistence, meaning the tasks are saved to a local SQLite database so that the tasks persist even after closing the app.

Features
Add Task: Add a task to the to-do list.
Remove Task: Remove a specific task from the list.
Delete All Tasks: Delete all tasks at once.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in an SQLite database (listOfTasks.db).
GUI: Simple and intuitive interface using Tkinter.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually bundled with Python)
SQLite (included with Python by default)
